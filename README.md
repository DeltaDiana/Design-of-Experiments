# The project of Design of Experiments (2016)

As a part of the course *Design of Experiments* at Lund University, I chose to to study the trading adage "Sell in May and go away" in my project. The data was taken from: [https://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/indexes/historical_prices?Instrument=SE0000337842](https://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/indexes/historical_prices?Instrument=SE0000337842). 

The data was then reversed (according to the date) by using Excel in order to plot the historical graph. The original one was then manipulated to be better suited for the purpose of the project, i.e. the data was cluttered and the missing values in the data were handled. This was made in Python before making the analysis in R. 

The project report can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5c585ypby25l80hu194pw/DOE_ProjectReport.pdf?rlkey=islsf8c0scr2jamvsm4x31ot5&dl=0).
